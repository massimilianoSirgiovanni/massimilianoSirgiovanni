<h2>My name is Massimiliano Sirgiovanni and this is my Github profile 🦆</h2>

<img src=intro_img.png> 

I studied Computer Science for years and I specialized in **Data Science** and **AI Engineering** 💻

<h3>Work Experiences 💼</h3>
<h4>Data Scientist 📊 at TECHENGINES.AI (May 2024 – Present)</h4>
<p>> Designed and optimized NLP pipelines using LLMs (e.g., Gemini
1.5, Gemma 2), covering the full data lifecycle—from data collection and preprocessing to model pipeline design, optimization,
and delivery of actionable insights to clients, supporting their
digital transformation initiatives
> The pipeline complexity was optimized, resulting in constant execution time with respect to input length.</p>

<h4>Undergraduate Internship 💻 at Magenta S.R.L. (Oct 2020 – Jan 2021)</h4>
<p>> Testing of the MQTT protocol and creation of an application prototype for the use case of automatic people counting</p>
